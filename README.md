**Arch linux, bspwm, yay, BlackArch Repos**

## Getting Started

### Existing Arch Linux install

- create a user, with sudo permissions
- clone the repo

```
cd hackistan
provisioners/install.sh
```

### Vagrant

This uses vagrant, but everything should work on a clean install of Arch

**OSX Note: sadly I couldn't get certain key combinations to work (super + {Left, Right, Up, Down}) so that has been mapped to alt**

```
vagrant up
```
